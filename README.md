# Lecture Notes on Various Algorithms

This repository contains the .tex files as well as the compiled .pdf files for lecture notes on algorithms (written by Joshua Kirstein).
The following topics are covered:

* Algorithms and Data Structures on Arrays (Prefix Sums, Segment Tree, Square Root Decomposition)
* Flow Networks (Maximum flow, Edmonds-Karp, Ford-Fulkerson, Applications)
* Trees (not binary trees... general/rooted trees)

Some of the notes are incomplete and will be finished in the near future. More notes will be added soon as well! If you have any questions, comments, or concerns email me at joshkirstein@aol.com.
